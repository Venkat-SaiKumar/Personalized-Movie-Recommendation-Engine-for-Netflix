# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-Engine-for-Netflix
Developed a personalized Movie Recommendation System using Python and Scikit-learn. Loaded and explored data from a CSV dataset, created a 'tags' feature by combining attributes, used CountVectorizer for text vectorization, and calculated cosine similarity for movie suggestions. Future plans include collaborative filtering and more metadata.
